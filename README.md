# ISC Final Project: Markov Model for Language
## Contributors(Equal): Naman Nimbale, Ramyak Bilas

## Project Overview
This project implements a Markov Chain-based language model for text generation. The language model analyzes text data, generates transition probabilities between words or n-grams, and produces realistic sequences of text based on trained probabilities. The model can be trained on any textual dataset and supports n-gram-based generation for flexible context handling.

### Project Plan:

#### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Objective**: Collect and prepare text data for training.
   - **Steps**:
     - Import training data from a directory containing text files.
     - Combine all text files into a single corpus.
   - **Deliverable**: A raw text corpus ready for preprocessing.

---

#### 2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - **Objective**: Clean and standardize the raw text data.
   - **Steps**:
     - Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.
     - Remove non-alphanumeric characters except essential punctuation (`.,!?`).
   - **Deliverable**: A clean and tokenized corpus.

---

#### 3. **Tokenization**
   - **Objective**: Split the preprocessed text into meaningful components.
   - **Steps**:
     - Tokenize the text into words.
     - Optionally, tokenize the text into sentences for additional structure.
   - **Deliverable**: A list of tokens (words or sentences).

---

#### 4. **Markov Chain Model Training**
   - **Objective**: Generate and store transition probabilities for text generation.
   - **Steps**:
     - Add special tokens (e.g., `<s>` for start and `</s>` for end) to mark sentence boundaries.
     - Generate n-grams from the tokenized text.
     - Compute transition probabilities between n-grams.
   - **Deliverable**: A trained model with transition probabilities.

---

#### 5. **Text Generation**
   - **Objective**: Generate realistic text sequences based on the trained model.
   - **Steps**:
     - Input a starting phrase (optional).
     - Sample words or phrases based on transition probabilities.
     - Replace end tokens with appropriate punctuation.
     - Format the generated text for readability (e.g., capitalization and spacing).
   - **Deliverable**: A sequence of generated text.

---

#### 6. **Model Testing and Validation**
   - **Objective**: Verify the model's correctness and assess its performance.
   - **Steps**:
     - Develop test cases using small, structured datasets.
     - Evaluate the transition probabilities and generated text.
     - Compare the results with expected outcomes.
   - **Deliverable**: A set of test results ensuring model reliability.

---

#### 7. **Saving and Loading the Model**
   - **Objective**: Enable reuse of the trained model.
   - **Steps**:
     - Save the model as an RDS file.
     - Load the model for future text generation without retraining.
   - **Deliverable**: Serialized model file for persistence.
